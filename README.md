# Marketing_Insights_on_BWIN_RShiny_RMarkdown
In this project we worked with a dataset from an online gambling website: Bwin Interactive Entertainment AG (GVC Holdings), to understand its customer base and draw marketing insights from it. 
The project involves primary data cleaning, processing and visualizing using R. We also created an web app using R Shiny and prepared the analytical report using RMarkdown. Check out the app here: https://poojashah.shinyapps.io/Bwin_Online_Gambling_Data_Analysis/. Each section refers to an aspect of analysis.
